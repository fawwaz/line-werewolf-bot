# Why I create this bot
If you never play werewolf, I suggest you to read a brief introduction about werewolf game here.

My first experience on playing werewolf was in TEC Gathering. I found it was so exciting that I almost couldn't stop playing it. Unfortunately, this game requires someone to be a narrator so he/she isn't involved in the game. Because of that, it is rarely to find a game that someone voluntarily proposing himself to be the narrator.

Besides of that, sometimes the narrator tend to favor one side over another. I usually play with a lean narrator that yelling out a provocative clue indicating which player is a werewolf or a seer. Off course, it won't be fun anymore if you meet that guy.

So considering all the reasons above, I had an idea to create this werewolf bot. Now, No one will be sacrified to play werewolf, and you won't meet an unfair narrator.
